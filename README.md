### GitHub Pages Deployment

Pushes to the `main` branch trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that runs
tests, builds the project and exports a static site. The exported files are
published to the `gh-pages` branch so they can be served via GitHub Pages.

Deployed with ZEIT NOW to `https://lingvist.alexanderbush7.now.sh/`

## Future Plans
Right now app queries json data hosted on github pages
Goal would be to add backend + database to make more functionality possible
